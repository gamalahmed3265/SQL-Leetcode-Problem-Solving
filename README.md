# SQL Leetcode Problem Solving

**Database:**

* A database is essentially a digital storage system for organized information. 
* It stores data in a structured format, typically in tables with rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. 
* Each table represents a specific category of information, and each row represents an individual record within that category.
* There are different types of databases, but the most common type used with SQL is a relational database.

**SQL (Structured Query Language):**

* SQL is a programming language specifically designed for interacting with relational databases. 
* It allows you to:
    * Create databases and tables within them
    * Insert, update, and delete data from the tables
    * Retrieve data based on specific criteria
    * Manage and optimize the database

**Relationship between SQL and Databases:**

* Think of SQL as the tool you use to control and access the data stored within a relational database.
* SQL statements are used to instruct the database management system (DBMS) to perform various tasks on the data.  
* Examples of popular DBMS that use SQL include MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
